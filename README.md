# WHERE TO NEXT (Traveling Sales "Men" Problem)

Where To Next is a Web Application developed for delivery companies. It is designed to minimize a companies cost while increasing its drivers efficiency by utilizing Clustering and Heuristic Search Algorithms. Given "n" delivery locations, the WebApp will compute the optimal number of delivery drivers (via clustering), allocate each driver their drop off location(from each Cluster) and display the best route for each driver to reach their allocated drop off locations (via Heuristic Algorithms to solve TSP)
